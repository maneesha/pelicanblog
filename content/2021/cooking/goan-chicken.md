I always cringe a little bit when I hear the word "curry" - that word does not mean what you think it means.  In any case, I'm just calling this Goan Chicken Curry because I don't know what else to call it.  It's loosely based on:

### Spice mix

* 2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1 tbsp coriander seeds
* 3 cloves
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 9-12 cloves garlic (depending on size)
* 2-3 inches ginger root, peeled and cut in half-inch pieces
* 1 large cinnamon stick, crushed in small pieces
* 2 tsp cinnamon stick
* 3/4 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp salt

### Curry

## Instructions

Mix chicken with buttermilk or yogurt and salt and refrigerate while you do the next steps.

Put all spice mix ingredients in small food processor and process until a coarse paste forms.

Saute 1 of the onions over medium high heat in 1 tbsp oil until onion starts to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add in processed spice mixture and cook for 8-10 minutes more.  

Add in coconut milk and water and stir to combine.  Drain and rinse chicken.  Add in chicken and sweet potato. Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

While curry is simmering, heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in small skillet over medium high heat.  Add in the other sliced onion and fry until onions are deep golden brown, stirring frequently.  Remove to paper towel lined plate.

Stir frozen peas into curry and simmer for 5 minutes more.

Serve with white rice. Top with fried onions. Garnish with fresh cilantro and chili peppers.
