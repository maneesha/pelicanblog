# What I was doing

Takes a file that was owned by bob@gmail.com and changes ownership to be bob@example.com

# Set up Google API 


# Set up service credentials 


# Make sure it's you


# Get all files in the google drive


# Get a list (set) of all unique file owners

# Change file ownership from bob@gmail.com to example_holder@gmail.com.  Note this works only for google drive files, not for uploaded images, pdfs, Excel spreadsheets, etc.  Ownership can only be transferred within a domain, so you can't transfer directly from bob@gmail.com to bob@example.com

# Move the transferred files to a carpentries shared drive, owned by the example.com domain, logging their original parent.  Knowing their original parent will be very important to 

# Move them back to their original parent.  This is why it's important to keep the log of the original parent.  If bob@example.com is proficient enough with Python and the API, they can do this themselves and they will be the new owner.  If bob@example.com can't do this, ali@example.com has this profiency and ali@example.com can do it.  However, this will make ali@example.com the new owner.  Ali can then transfer ownership from ali@example.com to bob@example.com.
