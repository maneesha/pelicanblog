* 3 average sized russet potatoes
* 1/2 cup water
* 3 tablespoons salt

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Heat the water to a near boil and add the salt.  Stir until salt is thoroughly dissolved.  Toss potatoes in salted water, and place potatoes directly on the oven rack.  Do not discard the salt water. Bake for 15 minutes.  Toss in salt water again, and return to oven rack for another 15 minutes. Toss in salt water for a third time, and return to oven rack for another 15 minutes.

Take potatoes out of oven and brush all over with olive oil.  Return to oven rack for 10 more minutes, to crisp up the outer skin.

Cut open and serve immediately.
