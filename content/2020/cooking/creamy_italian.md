* 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 2 tsp finely minced fresh garlic
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp Italian herb mix (or combine together herbs like oregano, basil, and thyme)
* 2 teaspoons honey

Put all ingredients in a small jar with a tight fitting lid.  Shake well until thoroughly combined.  I use my milk frother to get a smooth even consistency.  It probably keeps for a few days in the fridge, but I'm not making any food safety claims here.
