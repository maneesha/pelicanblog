This recipe is adapted from a recipe I tore out of some magazine long ago.  Having kept only a torn out half page, I can't credit it any more than that.  I make small adaptations in the salt, spices, and ginger quantities I use. These are delicious topped with a [simple glaze (recipe below)](#simple-glaze).

### Ginger cookies

* 1.5 cups all purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground allspice
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 6 tbsp softened butter
* 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1 tbsp molasses
* 1 egg
* 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger root
* 1 tbsp finely chopped crystalized ginger (optional)

Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ground ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg in a bowl and mix well.  Put butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl and beat on medium speed until creamy. Add molasses, egg, and ginger root and beat until well mixed.  Add in dry ingredients and beat on low speed until well mixed. 

Refrigerate until firm (at least 1-2 hours).

Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  While oven is heating, shape dough into 1 to 2 tablespoon sized balls. Place two inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Flatten the balls slightly with the bottom of a glass.

Bake 9-12 minutes unil puffed and centers just start to set. Cool for 1 minute on the baking sheet. Remove to cooling rack and let cool completely.      

### Simple Glaze

* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 2-3 tbsp lemon juice
* Food coloring (optional)

Combine sugar and 2 tbsp lemon juice in bowl. Stir until a smooth glaze forms, adding more lemon juice as needed if the glaze is too thick.  This will thicken quickly while it sits.

This can be separated into small bowls, adding a few drops of food coloring to each bowl as desired.
