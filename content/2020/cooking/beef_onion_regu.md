* 1 to 1 1/4- lb boneless beef chuck eye roast
* 2 oz pancetta cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 2 oz salami cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 small carrot peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 small celery rib cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 3-4 garlic cloves
* 2 Â½ lb onions halved and cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup red wine, divided
* 2 tbsp minced fresh marjoram, divided
* 1 lb rigatoni
* 1 oz Pecorino Romano cheese grated (1/2 cup), plus extra for serving

Put the pancetta and salami in a food processor, and process 10-15 pulses until a paste forms.  Without cleaning the food processor, add in the carrot, celery, and garlic.  Process until finely minced.  Set aside in a small bowl.  Add in onions, and process until coarsely chopped.

Put the salami-panchetta paste in a large Dutch oven and cook over medium heat until fat renders out and fond begins to form at bottom of pot, stirring frequently. Add in the carrot-celery-garlic mixture, and cook for 3-4 minutes.

Add in tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to brown (about 1-2 minutes).

Add in two cups of water and use it to stir up any brown bits.

Add in the onions and bring to a boil. Add in half the wine and half the marjoram. Add in the beef pieces, being sure they are submerged.  Cut them in smaller pieces if it looks like they won't stay under.  Return to a boil.  Move to the oven, uncovered.

Cook in the oven for 2 - 2.5 hours, until the meat is tender.

Remove pot from oven, and transfer meat to another plate.  Cook the remaining sauce down until it is almost dry. Add in the remaining wine.

Shred the beef into bite size pieces and return it to the pot. Add in the remaining marjoram and season with salt and pepper to taste. The only salt before this comes from the salami and pancetta. Cover and keep warm over low heat while you cook the pasta.

Cook one pound of rigatoni until just before al dente.  Set aside one cup of the cooking water before draining well.  Add the pasta to the sauce and add in more pasta water as needed to loosen up the sauce.

Add Pecorino and stir vigorously over low heat until sauce is slightly thickened and rigatoni is fully tender, 1 to 2 minutes.
