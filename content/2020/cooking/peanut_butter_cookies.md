While we're all living in isolation, [Alton Brown](https://youtu.be/0nalyEGpuSs) has been making cooking videos from home.  Here's a slight adaptation of the peanut butter cookies he made.  He was aiming for gluten free cookies, but I added in a tiny bit of flour to hold everything together a little better. I also added in chocolate chips (because chocolate and peanut butter belong together).


* 1 cup peanut butter
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 tbsp all purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Mix together the peanut butter and the sugars.  Add in the egg and vanilla.

Mix together the baking soda, flour, and salt. Combine the wet and dry ingredients and mix well.  Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.

Spoon 1 - 1.5 tablespoon portions on to a cookie sheet.  Bake for 8-12 minutes. Let cool.
