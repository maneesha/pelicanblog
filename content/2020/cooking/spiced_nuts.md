This is adapted slightly from [America's Test Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUoKNXTeAY4).

* 1 egg white
* 1 tb water
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 lb raw whole almonds
* 1/2 c sugar
* 1 tb ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1/2 tsp cayenne powder


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Beat together the egg white, water, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add in the almonds and coat evenly.

Mix the sugar and all spices together in a small bowl, and add to the almonds.  Mix again to coat evenly.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the nut mixture out in an even layer.  Bake for 40 minutes, turning the pan once halfway through.  

Let cool thoroughly on the baking sheet.  The hot sugar burning you aside, these will be quite soft when they are still warm.  They will be crunchy once they cool to room temperature.  Store in a jar with a tight fitting lid.
