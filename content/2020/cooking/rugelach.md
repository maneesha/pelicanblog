This is a recipe for rugelach from Cooks Country magazine.  It's shared here mostly as originally published, but modified to accomodate various fillings.  I also add a touch extra salt (as I do with all my sweet baked goods).  Lastly, I had to bake for much longer than the original recipe called for.

Rugelach are delicious and I always assumed were difficult to make but this actually comes together relatively easily!

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) all purpose flour
* 1/3 cup (1 3/4 ounces) granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon table salt
* 6 ounces cream cheese, cut in 3 pieces and chilled
* 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut in 1/2 inch pieces and chilled
* 1/4 cup sour cream
* 1/4 to 1/3 cup each of two fillings (see below)
* 1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar or demerara sugar


### Recipe

Process flour, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds.  Add in cream cheese and pulse about 5 times, until you have chunks of cream cheese interspersed with flour.

Add butter piefces and pulse until until butter is the size of small peas, about 5 to 7 pulses.

Add sour cream and process until a crumbly dough forms that holds together when pinched with your fingers, about 10 seconds.

Transfer dough to counter and knead until it just comes together.  Divide into two equal portions (each will weigh about 11 ounces), and shape each into a 4 inch disk.  Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 48 hours.

When ready to bake, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375 degrees F.   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Roll out one of the disks into a 12 inch circle on a lightly floured counter.  Spread 1/4 to 1/3 cup of your topping of choice over the whole circle.  Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut circle into 16 wedges (like a pizza).

Roll each wedge into a spiral starting at the edge and moving towards the point.  Transfer to the baking sheet, seam side down.

Brush each wedge with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.  Do this about 4 pieces at a time, so the egg doesn't dry out before sprinkling the sugar on it.

Do this again with the second disk of dough.

The original recipe says to bake for 30-35 minutes.  I found it took me 45-50 minutes.  Let cool for 20 minutes.  I found these lasted about 3-4 days at room temperature before they started tasting stale.

### Topping options

* Fruit jam.  Process in food processor if it's very chunky.
* Nutella
* Cinnamon walnut topping. Process 1/4 cup walnuts, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon table salt, until finely ground.
