Oven fries, as seen on [America's Test Kitchen](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/videos/4016-thick-cut-oven-fries).  This includes my notes for making them with russet potatoes (they use Yukon Gold).

* 18 oz potatoes (russet or Yukon Gold - see notes below)
* 2 tb corn starch
* 1/2 c water
* 2 tb vegetable oil
* Salt

Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F.

Spray baking sheet evenly with non-stick cooking spray.  Drizzle vegetable oil over pan.  The combination of the spray and oil is important as the spray helps the oil spread evenly over the pan. Put the pan in the oven while you prepare the potatoes.

Cut potatoes in sticks or planks (like thick cut steak fries) and put in large bowl.

Mix corn starch and water in small bowl, and microwave in 10-15 second increments until it has a loose, pudding like consistency.  Add in a few drops of water if it gets too thick.

Toss the corn starch mixture with the potatoes until evenly coated.

Take baking sheet out of oven and tilt around until oil is evenly spread out.  Lay potato wedges in single layer in pan.  Cover with foil or another pan and return to oven for times indicated below.  

**Timing**
America's Test Kitchen does this with Yukon Gold Potatoes and suggests putting them in the oven first for 12-18 minutes. Then uncover the pan and flip the potatoes over.  At this point the bottom should be nicely browned. Return uncovered to the oven for another 12-18 minutes. 

I'm more likely to have russet potatoes on hand at home, and I've found these take much longer to brown.  I do just as above, but for about 30 minutes in each cycle, or about an hour of baking time total.

Remove to serving dish and salt immediately.
