Title: About me


**About me**

 My formal academic background is in education, psychology, and linguistics. I often like to say my graduate degree was another liberal arts degree.  It all led me to working for over 15 years in the fields of education and nonprofit administration in many environments including K-12 schools, universities, museums, and community centers.

In 2010, a severly broken leg left me homebound for a few months. I used that time to start teaching myself programming.  I started off in Python (which will always be my dominant language), got deep in to SQL, and picked up some VBA, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along the way. For the past couple of years I have been managing software training programs for two sibling organizations called [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) â€“ which has been a really nice way of combining this varied background. I get to work with some amazing scientists, researchers, and educators through this work. I'm also one of the organizers of the local [Python Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/phillypug/) where I also get to meet cool Python programmers and hear about the work they do.

I have a few hobby projects that seem to be in a perpetual state of being half-done.  I attribute this to [Zeno's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes) - I will never reach the end point.  These projects include:

* trying to download and analyze on-time performance for SEPTA's Regional Rail system
* trying to [find and analyze results](http://phlcitycouncil.pythonanywhere.com/) from [Philadelphia's](http://www.phila.gov) [City Council](http://phlcouncil.com/) [elections](https://www.philadelphiavotes.com/).  
* building a [searchable map](http://toynbeeidea.com/where/#page-map) of [Toynbee Tiles](http://www.toynbeeidea.com/)


And of course, there's this blog, powered by Python and Pelican.  The blog isn't much to look at - I could never be a front end developer.  It's mainly a way for me to save all my notes about programming, my favorite recipes (another hobby), and such in an easy to find place.
