My husband likes to make fish tacos. They’re very good (and maybe one day he’ll share his recipe here) but he often buys a whole head of red cabbage and slices up just a little bit of it to top the tacos with. This means we end up with a whole lot of leftover cabbage that we never know what to do with. I decided to use it by making a braised red cabbage with kielbasa. I made my own recipe inspired by a recipe at [allrecipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/grandma-jeanettes-amazing-german-red-cabbage/) and one at [chow](http://www.chow.com/recipes/10712-braised-red-cabbage-with-bacon).

##Ingredients

* 1 onion (sliced) 
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 head of red cabbage (or almost 1 head)
* 1/3 cup red wine vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 2 tb brown sugar
* 2 tb dijon mustard
* 1 lb kielbasa sausage
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Start by cooking 1 sliced onion in about one tablespoon of butter. Once that’s lightly browned, add 2 smashed garlic cloves and let that cook for one minute. You don’t need to finely mince the garlic – it’ll break down as the whole thing simmers.

While the onion is cooking, slice one head of red cabbage. Also mix together 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons dijon mustard. Add the cabbage to the onions. Pour the vinegar mixture over the cabbage and toss.

Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.

Once the cabbage starts simmering, slice up some kielbasa sausage and brown it in about 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a skillet or frying pan. By the time the sausage is brown, you should have about 30 minutes left in cabbage braising time. Add the sausage to the braising cabbage for those last 30 minutes – this will help the flavors meld.

Serve with bread or mashed potatoes.
