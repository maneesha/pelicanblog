I love spaghetti and meatballs. There’s not much more I can say about that. But no one likes a meatball that’s dry and crumbly, or one that’s so soft that it can’t hold its shape. One of my [favorite meatball recipes](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/italian_meatballs/) comes from Elyse Bauer at Simply Recipes. She writes it as a recipe for meatballs as a standalone dish. I make it exactly as she does, only I use it to top spaghetti.

One day I will re-write it per her guidelines so I can post it here (and so I never lose it if her site ever goes down!). For now, just a few notes:

While I was making this, I also boiled spaghetti, made a side salad, and made garlic bread. This brought the total cook time to almost 2 hours.

This made enough sauce for almost 1 lb spaghetti, after adding about 1/2 c. pasta cooking liquid to the sauce.

This made about 35 meatballs using a 3 tbsp. scoop for each one. I use about 10-12 of them at a time. I freeze the half-cooked meatballs without any sauce, and then make just the sauce later and drop the frozen meatballs back in and simmer for about 20 minutes.
