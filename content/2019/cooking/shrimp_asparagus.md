Adapted from a recipe in [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/shrimp-and-asparagus-stir-fry).


* 1 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
* 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine (Chinese rice wine) or dry sherry
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
* 6 scallions, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces on the diagonal
* 1 3-inch piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced crosswise
* 1 pound asparagus, woody ends snapped off, cut into 1-inch pieces on the diagonal
* 1/4 cup roasted peanutes
* 1 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds


Toss shrimp, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, a pinch of salt, and 1 Tbsp. soy sauce in a medium bowl. Stir vinegar, wine, and remaining 2 Tbsp. soy sauce in a small bowl. Have all your other ingredients prepped and ready to go (once you start cooking, there isn’t a stopping point and you’ll need them handy).

Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet (not nonstick) over high. When oil is shimmering and slides quickly across surface of pan, add asparagus, scallions, and ginger and cook, tossing often, until asparagus is bright green and crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer asparagus mixture to another medium bowl.

Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet over high. When oil is shimmering again, add shrimp mixture and arrange in a single layer in skillet. Cook, undisturbed, until shrimp are pink around the edges and first side is golden, about 1 minute. Toss and continue to cook until shrimp are opaque all the way through, about a minute or two longer. 

Pour in wine mixture and asparagus mixture and cook, tossing briskly, until sauce is thickened and all ingredients are coated, about 30 seconds.  Add peanuts and sesame seeds. Serve with rice or noodles.
