This is one of my favorite cookie recipes because it's quick and easy. It only makes a few cookies which is good because I'd just eat them all -- but you could probably scale it up. These come out very moist and soft - delicious but not durable enough for a lunchbox or party tray.

- 4 tb butter
- 1/3 cup chocolate chips
- 1 egg
- 2 tb sugar
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 c flour

Put the butter and chocolate chips in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds. Stir for a minute and let the chocolate chips and butter melt together. If necessary, microwave for another 10 seconds, and stir to melt together. You may need to do this for another 10 seconds.

Beat the egg, sugar, vanilla, and salt together, add to the butter and chocolate and mix well. Add in flour and mix just to combine.

Refrigerate for one hour. Spoon 1-2 tablespoon size scoops on to parchment lined baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Makes about a dozen cookies.
