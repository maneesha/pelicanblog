A paratha is a layered, flaky Indian flatbread.  Aloo paratha adds in a layer of spiced potatoes between layers of whole wheat dough. When I was a kid, my mother's take on this would be to combine flour and potatoes in a single dough - and this remains one of my favorite lunches.

* 2 pounds russet potatoes
* 2 tablespoons grated ginger root
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons minced cilantro
* 2 tablespoons salt
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more to drizzle while cooking.
* 10-14 ounces whole wheat flour
* Oil for cooking 


Boil or steam the potatoes until they are tender.  Process them through a potato ricer or box grater.  Mix in the giner, garlic cilantro, salt, and onion until evenly combined.

Add in 10 ounces of whole wheat flour. Knead until well combined, and continue kneading for about 5 minutes.  Let sit for 30 minutes.  


Knead dough again for another minute. 

Generously flour your work surface.  Take one approximately 3 ounce ball (about the size of a golf ball).  Roll out into a thin layer.  If it seems too soft and sticky, add a little more flour to the dough and knead to incorporate. 

Continue taking 3 ounce balls, rolling out into a thin layer. 

In a non-stick skillet or griddle, over medium heat, drizzle a tiny amount of vegetable oil.  Cook the paratha on one side for 1-2 minutes until you start to see brown spots.  Drizzle a tiny amount of oil over the uncooked side, flip, and cook for another 1-2 minutes.  

Serve with yogurt and mango pickle.
