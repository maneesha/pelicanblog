This is adapted from a Cooks Illustrated recipe for Quick Stovetop Roast Chicken (November/December 2008), to be not so quick -- because long and slow roasted chicken is way better.  Active cooking time remains the same but total cooking time goes up by about an hour.

Chicken 
* 6 bone in, skin on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
* Salt and pepper
* 1 tb vegetable oil
* 1 - 1.25 cups chicken broth

Pan Sauce
* 1 medium shallot chopped fine (about 3-4 tablespoons)
* 1 tsp all purpose flour
* zest of 1 lemon
* juice of 1 lemon
* 1 1/2 tbsp chopped parsley
* 1 1/2 tbsp chopped chives

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Pat chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 tsp vegetable oil in large large cast iron or carbon steel pan.  Add chicken thighs skin side down and cook without moving until skin is golden brown, 5-8 minutes.

Flip chicken to be skin side up.  Add 3/4 cup chicken broth and bring to simmer.  Cover pan and move to oven for 45-60 minutes, until chicken is tender.

Remove pan from oven.  Transfer chicken to plate, keeping it skin side up.  

Pour off liquid from pan into fat separator and allow to settle 5-10 minutes.  While this sits, return chicken pieces to pan skin side down and cook undisturned until skin is deep golden brown, 4-7 minutes.  Transfer chicken to serving plate and tent loosely with foil.

Pour separated chicken juices into measuring cup, and add more broth until this measures 1 cup total.  

Add 1 teaspoon fat back to the pan (and save the rest for something delicious later). Add shallot and cook 1-2 minutes until soft.  Add flour and cook stirring constantly for 30 seconds.  Add reserved 3/4 cup liquid and bring to simmer, scraping up all the brown bits.  Simmer until this reduces to about 1/2 cup (about 3-4 minutes).  Add in juices from resting chicken.  Off heat, add in lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, and chives.  Serve chicken with sauce poured on side. Do not pour sauce on chicken - this will ruin the crispy skin.
