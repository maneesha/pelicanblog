Here's another pork and green beans recipe.  It has the same base ingredients but a very different taste.  My other recipe is super strong and spicy; this one is mild but still complex.  This one is adapted from a recipe in [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pork-stir-fry-with-green-beans-and-peanuts-108451), to be less honey-sweet and have some more complex garlic and ginger flavors with just a bit of spice.  


* 12 ounces pork tenderloin, cut into small strips
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 1/2 tablespoons grated ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
* 1 pound green beans, trimmed, cut into 1-2 inch pieces 
* 1 cup matchstick-size strips carrots
* 2 tablespoons canola oil
* 1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1-2 inch strips
* 3 green onions, thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup finely chopped lightly salted dry-roasted peanuts


Mix pork, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, honey, half of garlic, half of ginger, and crushed red pepper in medium bowl. 

Cook green beans in large saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add carrots to green beans in water; cook 1 minute. Drain carrots and green beans. 

Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in wok or large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add pork mixture; stir-fry 1 minute. Transfer pork to dish. Add remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil to wok; add red bell pepper and stir-fry 1 minute. Add green beans, carrots, and remaining garlic and ginger; stir-fry 1 minute. Return pork to wok along with remaining soy sauce; stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl. Sprinkle with sliced green onions and chopped peanuts and serve.
