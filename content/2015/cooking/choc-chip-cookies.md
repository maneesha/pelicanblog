I don't know anyone who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies. One of my favorite recipes comes from [Cook's Illustrated](http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/4737-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies) (warning: paywall), but is pretty time consuming in browing the butter, repeated mixing and resting, etc.

I've found a few simpler recipes and tweaked them until I developed this one that's just as good but with much less fuss.  The only thing is that it requires chilling, so it's less active work but you don't necessarily get immediate gratification.

* 3 tb unsalted butter, melted 
* Salt
* 1/3 cup light brown sugar + molasses (that is, fill a 1/3 cup dry measure about halfway with brown sugar and the rest of the way with molasses)
* 2 tb white sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg yolk (discard white or save for something else later)
* 3/4 c. AP flour
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/3 c chocolate chips (or chunks or chopped bar)
* More salt

Add a generous pinch of salt to the butter.  Add in the sugars and mix well.  You should end up with a toffee like mixture.

Add in the vanilla and egg yolk. Be sure the butter & sugar mixture is cool so it won't cook the egg.

Mix together the flour and baking soda and add to the egg-sugar-butter mixture.  Mix until well combined.  The dough will be on the dry side.  Mix in chocolate chips.

Chill dough for 1-48 hours; the longer the better.  Scoop out 1-2 tb size portions and arrange 2-3 inches apart on ungreased & unlined cookie sheet.  If you like the look of a smooth cookie, roll the balls between your palms to make smooth balls.  I like a craggly looking cookie so I don't shape the portions at all. Sprinkle each dough ball with kosher salt. The salt is *key* to bringing out all the other flavors.  I forgot it once and it just wasn't the same.

Bake at 375 deg. F for 8-10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let sit on hot cookie sheet for 5 minutes.  Remove from sheet to cooking rack.  Wait as long as you can before eating (which for me isn't very long).  Makes about 12-16 cookies.
