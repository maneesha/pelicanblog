Ingredients

* 1 cup peanut oil
* 1 cup flour
* 2 cups chopped onion
* 1 cup chopped green bell pepper
* 1 cup chopped celery
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tbsp cajun seasoning
* 1 ham hock
* 10 cups water
* 3 lbs assorted hearty greens (kale, spinach, etc.)
* salt
* 1 lb smoked andouille sausage


Heat the peanut oil in a heavy dutch oven over medium heat.  Slowly sprinkle in the flour and whisk well until smooth.  Cook the roux over medium low heat stirring constantly until it is a chocolaty brown. Keep an eye on it - it will burn easily if the heat gets too hot or if you don't keep it moving.

Add in the onion, pepper, and celery and bring heat to medium.  Cook until vegetables soften.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more.  

Add the bay leaves and cajun seasoning and stir well to combine.  Slowly add in the water, stirring along the way to be sure there are no clumps. Add the ham hock and the greens.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 60-90 minutes, until the ham hock is falling off the bone.

While the gumbo is simmering, slice the andouille sausage into one inch pieces.  Brown in 1 tb vegetable oil.  Add the sausage and the drippings to the gumbo while it is simmering.  

Remove the ham hock from the gumbo and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Pull the meat off in small pieces and stir back into the gumbo.

Serve with rice, file powder, and hot sauce.
