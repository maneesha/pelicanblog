Based on Cooks Illustrated recipe for French Pork and White Beans Casserole (Cassoulet).

Ingredients

* 1 lb dried canellini beans

* 1 bay leaf

* 4 sprigs thyme

* 5 tb vegetable oil

* 1 1/2 lbs garlic sausage, cut in 1 inch pieces.

* 4 oz salt pork, bacon, or pancetta, chopped finely

* 1 1/2 lbs pork shoulder, cut in 1 inch pieces

* 1 large onion, chopped

* 2 carrots, chopped

* 3 celery ribs, chopped

* 4 cloves garlic, minced

* 1 tb tomato paste

* 1/2 c white wine

* 5 c chicken broth


Soak beans overnight in 3 quarts salted water.  Drain and rinse.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

Tie together bay leaves and thyme with kitchen twine.

Put 1 tb vegetable oil in a dutch oven and heat until shimmering. Brown sausage in oil.  You do not need to cook the sausage through now.

Set sausage aside.  Add one more tablespoon of oil and brown pork pieces on all sides. Set pork aside.

Add one more tablespoon of oil to pot and cook onion, carrots, and celery until vegetables start to soften.  Add garlic and tomato paste, and cook another 30 seconds.  Add white wine and deglaze pot.  Stir in thyme bundle and salt pork.  

Stir in broth and beans. Add back pork and sausage. Add any water necessary to be sure beans and meat are completely submerged. Bring pot to simmer and cover.  Transfer pot to oven and cook until beans are tender (about 1 1/2 hours).  

Remove from oven and increase oven temperature to 350 degrees.  Skim off any excess fat from surface.  Stir ingredients together and return to oven, uncovered, 30 minutes more.
