Ingredients

This is just the recipe for the marinade.  Someday I'll be better and post instructions on how to grill it -- or as I sometimes do, cook in a super hot cast iron pan.

* 1/2 c olive oil

* 1/3 soy sauce

* 4 scallions, coarsely chopped

* 4 cloves garlic, crushed

* 1 tsp red pepper flakes

* 1/2 tsp ground cumin

* 3 tb dark brown sugar

* 2 lbs flank steak or skirt steak, cut in ~6 inch long pieces

Puree all ingredients except steak in blender.  Put steak in ziploc bag and pour marinade over it.  Marinade in refrigerator for one hour.
