This is based on a [Chicken and Orzo recipe](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/one_pot_chicken_and_orzo/) from Simply Recipes - one of my favorite recipe sites.  I made it once when I was looking for something to do with the boneless chicken thighs in my freezer.  I decided to adapt this recipe, and it's since become one of my standards.  Most of my recipes serve 3-4.  That's just right for my family of three, plus lunch for one of us to take to school or work the next day.

Serves 3-4.

* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* 1/2 c.  AP flour
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 4 tb vegetable oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 1/2 cup orzo
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 14 oz can crushed tomatoes
* 2 cups water
* 2 tb chopped fresh parsley


Cut the chicken thighs in thirds.  

Mix the flour, 1 tsp salt, pepper, and thyme in a large bowl.  Toss the chicken thigh pieces to evenly coat.

Heat 3 tb vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.  Cook the chicken pieces until brown, about 5 minutes on each side. They do not need to be cooked through. Depending on the size of your skillet you may need to do this in batches - don't crowd the pan.

Set chicken aside. Add 1 tb oil to the skillet.  Add onions and 1 tsp salt and cook until the onions are brown, about 5 minutes.  Add orzo and saute for about three minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and water and stir until everything is evenly combined.  Taste for salt here - before you add the partially cooked chicken back in.  It shoud be just a little bit too salty since the orzo and chicken will be soaking in all that liquid.

Nestle  browned chicken pieces in skillet and bring to a boil.  Lower to a *very* low simmer, cover, and cook about 15 minutes, until orzo is al dente.

Serve sprinkled with fresh parsley.
