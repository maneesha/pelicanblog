I grew up on food like Hamburger Helper (yes, that boxed mix that you mix with ground beef and water).  I think that [this recipe](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cheesy_hamburger_pasta_skillet/) from Simply Recipes was inspired by the same thing.  I've adapted this recipe here.


Serves 4.

* 3/4 lb. ground beef
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 1/2 cups chicken broth
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 2 tbsp all purpose flour
* 1 tsp cayenne powder 
* 8 egg noodles or short curly pasta like rotini
* 1 1/2 cups frozen peas
* 2 cups (about 4 oz) shredded cheddar cheese

Brown the ground beef in a large pot like a Dutch oven.  Remove it from the pot with a slotted spoon to a bowl, leaving behind the drippings. 

Add the diced onion to the beef drippings and cook until onions are soft and brown, about 5 minutes.  Add minced garlic and cook another minute more.  Remove onion and garlic and put in bowl with beef.

Add the broth and milk to the pot and bring to a gentle simmer.  Sprinkle in the flour and cayenne. (I use a mesh strainer for this to ensure it does not clump.)  Whisk this all together until mixture is slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes.

Add the noodles or pasta to the milk mixture and stir well.  Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until noodles are cooked (around 8 minutes, but will vary with your pasta).

Add the peas, ground beef, and onions to the pot and mix well. Add in cheese and mix until the cheese is melted.  Add some more milk if the sauce seems too thick.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
