Add remaining 1 tb oil to the pot and add onion, lemon zest, 1 tsp salt, and cook until onions start to brown. While this is cooking, mix together chicken broth and honey until honey is disolved.  Add in garlic, paprikas, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cayenne and cook for 30 seconds more.  Add in broth and honey mixture, scraping up any brown bits.

Add browned chicken thighs and carrots.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until chicken is at 175 degrees F, about 15-20 minutes.

Stir in olives and apricots and cook for 5 minutes more.

Serve with couscous.
