This is a recipe my husband printed out many years ago from a website that no longer exists.

* 1 lb yams, peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes.
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 inch piece of ginger root, minced
* 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 2 green cardamom pods
* 1 bay leaf
* 4 peppercorns
* 1 inch piece cinnamon stick
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 4 oz fresh or canned tomatoes, roughly chopped
* 1 2/3 cup water
* 1/3 cup yogurt
* 1 tbsp cilantro leaves


Heat oil over medium heat and add cumin seeds until they start to sputter.  Add the onion and cook until it begins to soften.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for one minute.

Add the remaining spices and cook until fragrant, about one minute.

Add the tomatoes, water, and salt to taste.  Add yogurt, mix well, and bring to a simmer.  Add yam cubes, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes.

Serve with rice garnished wtih cilantro.
