This is a shrimp stir fry based on a recipe from a Cooks Illustrated cookbook.  It uses a lot of the same ingredients in my Kung Pao style stir fry recipe but the sauce is quite different.  For the bean paste, I usually use whatever bean paste I have on hand - usually either broad bean paste or Korean bean paste (doenjang).  Cilantro is not something I would have thought to put in here but it makes it really good.


##### Marinade

* 1 tb vegetable oil
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp baking soda

##### Sauce

* 1.5 tb mirin
* 1 tb bean paste
* 1 tb chili garlic paste
* 1 tb vinegar
* 1 tb soy sauce
* 1 tb sesame oil
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp corn starch
* 1/2 tsp szechuan peppercorns, toasted and crushed

##### Rest of ingredients

* 1/2 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 1/4 cup peanuts
* 1 medium zucchini, cut in half moons
* 1 bell pepper, cut in bite size pieces
* 1 small onion, cut in bite size pieces
* 4 tb vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup cilantro, loosely packed, coarsely chopped

Mix the shrimp with the marinade ingredients and put in fridge until ready to use, no more than about 20 minutes.

Combine all the sauce ingredients and set aside.

Brown the peanuts in a large skillet or wok and set aside.

Stir fry the zucchini, bell pepper, and onion in two tablespoons oil for 3-5 minutes, until they are just tender, and remove from pan. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and stir fry for about 5 minutes, until the shrimp is cooked through (this depends on the size of your shrimp).  Add back the vegetables, the remaining marinade, and the sauce and bring to a boil.  Mix in the peanuts and cilantro and cook for one minute.

Serve with white rice.
