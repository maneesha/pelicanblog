Another old printout of an old recipe my husband wanted to keep.  This one is from Mark Bittman.

* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* Juice of 1/2 lime
* Ground black pepper to taste
* 1 tuna steak, about 2 pounds, 1.5 - 2 inches thick

Place cilantro, garlic, and salt on cutting board and mince everything together.  Mix in a bowl with olive oil, lime juice, and pepper.

Make a small incision half way across any edge of the tuna steak. Do not cut through top, bottom, or other sides of steak.

Stuff pocket with about 3/4 of the cilantro pesto, leaving behind most of the oil and some of the solids.  Seal opening with toothpicks or skewers.

Marinate fish in remaining pesto while grill heats to high.

Grill tuna, turning once, abotu 6 minutes total per inch of thickness. For a 2 inch thick steak, grill 6 minutes, turn once, and grill 6 minutes more.

Serve cut into 1/2 inch thick slices.  Makes about 4 8-ounce or 5 6-ounce servings.
