This is a stir fry that is loosely based on recipes I've seen for [Kung Pao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Pao_chicken) Chicken or Shrimp.  Raw peanuts are good but hard to find.  Szechuan peppercorns can also be hard to find but really make this dish.  I prefer this with chicken but have shrimp in my freezer more often. 


Serves 3.

Marinade

* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp rice wine
* 2 1/2 tsp cornstarch

Sauce

* 1 tb sugar 
* 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp Chinese black vinegar
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tb water

* 1 boneless chicken breast sliced very thin or about 1/2 lb. peeled & deveined shrimp
* 1 medium sized zucchini
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 medium onion
* 1/4 c. peanuts
* 1 tsp Szechuan peppercorns
* 10 dried chilis
* 4 tb vegetable oil
* 1 tb minced or grated ginger
* 1 tb minced or grated garlic


Mix meat with marinade and return to fridge.

Mix together sauce ingredients and set aside.

Cut zucchini into half moons.  Cut bell pepper and onion into bite size pieces.  

Roast peanuts in wok until they start to brown. Set aside.  Roast peppercorns until they start to brown.  Remove from wok and crush in a mortar and pestle.  

Finely chop the dried chiles.  Put vegetable oil in wok over high heat and add chilis.  Reduce heat to medium low and fry chilies 2-3 minutes.  Return heat to medium high.  Add zucchini, bell pepper, and onion and stir fry for 3-5 minutes.  Add meat and stir fry until meat is cooked through.  The time will vary based on how thinly you sliced your chicken or what size your shrimp are.

Add in ginger and garlic.  Stir fry for about one minute and add in sauce.  Mix everything until well combined.  Serve topped with peanuts and peppercorns with steamed rice.
