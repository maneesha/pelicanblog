Ingredients

* One whole chicken (~4 pounds)
* 6 tb butter
* 2 tb minced fresh sage
* 2 tb minced fresh thyme
* Salt and pepper
* 2 medium onions, chopped
* 3 ribs celery, chopped
* 5-6 cups cheap Italian bread, cut in 1/2 inch cubes

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Melt 4 tablespoons butter and mix in the herbs. Rub this all over the chicken, inside and out.  Set chicken aside on a plat.

Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in large oven safe skillet and add onions and celery.  Cook 5-7 minutes, until they are soft.

Arrange bread cubes in even layer over onion and celery.  Place chicken on top of bread cubes and pour in any excess butter from plate.

Bake 60-90 minutes, until breasts are at 160 degrees F and thighs are 175 degrees F.  Turn broiler on and broil for about 10 minutes, until chicken skin is brown and crispy.

Remove chicken from pan and set on clean plate to rest for 10 minutes.  Add broth to stuffing in pan, stir to evenly distribute, and return under broiler for 5-10 minutes while chicken rests.
