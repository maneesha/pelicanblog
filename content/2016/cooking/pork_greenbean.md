This is based on a recipe from a pan Asian cookbook by Madhur Jaffrey.  It's a Thai recipe she calls "Moo pad prik sai tua fak yao."  I always like to look up variations of recipes but googling that phrase returns only Jaffrey's recipe.  There must be another translated phrase that even Google's super predictive algorithms can't pick up on. I've made a few minor adjustments to her recipe here.

* 2 tb soy sauce
* 1 lb ground pork
* 12-16 garlic cloves, minced
* 10 green or red chilis, chopped
* 3 tb vegetable oil
* 1/2 tsp sweet paprika
* 1 tb brown sugar
* 3 tb fish sauce
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 tsp corn starch
* 1 lb green beans, trimmed and cut in 1-2 inch pieces


Mix the soy sauce into the pork and set aside.

Heat the oil in a wok over medium high heat. Add in the garlic and chilis, immediately reduce heat to medium low and cook for 3-5 minutes until fragrant and just starting to brown.  Add in the pork and cook for about 5 minutes.  It may still be pinkish.  

While that's cooking, mix together the paprika, brown sugar, fish sauce, water, and corn starch.

Add in the green beans and fish sauce mixture.  Mix well and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for about 5 - 10 minutes until pork is cooked through and beans are just tender.

Serve with white rice.
